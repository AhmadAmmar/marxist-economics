# Financialisation, real estate, and fictitious capital

When profitability in productive sectors is squeezed, capital tends to
search for easier routes to profit: finance, real estate, speculation on
currencies and commodities. This is often called **financialisation**.

## Fictitious capital

**Fictitious capital** refers to *tradable claims* on future income streams
ultimately grounded in surplus value: shares (claims on profits/dividends), bonds and loans
(claims on interest), mortgage-backed securities (claims on interest and principal), and
many derivatives (claims whose payoffs are linked to the prices of other claims).
It is “fictitious” not because it is unreal, but because it is a *title* to future
income rather than a direct embodiment of value already produced and currently functioning
as capital in production.[HarveyNewImperialism]

A share can be understood as a claim on a stream of expected future profits (or dividends);
a bond as a claim on a stream of interest payments; and many structured assets as claims on
bundled or re-sliced cash flows. A basic way to see this is capitalisation. If an asset is
expected to yield net receipts $R_t$ (dividends, interest, rents, or other contractual payoffs)
over time, and those receipts are discounted at rate $d$ (which may incorporate risk and liquidity),
then its market valuation can be written schematically as
\begin{equation}
  K_f = \sum_{t=1}^{\infty} \frac{R_t}{(1+d)^t}.
\end{equation}
We use $d$ (not $i$) for the discount rate to avoid confusing it with the commodity index $i$
used elsewhere. This is a stylised expression (it assumes a stable discounting convention and a
reasonably well-defined expected flow), but it captures the key point: the market value of the
claim can move sharply even when the underlying production of value changes little.

Here $K_f$ is not “capital” in the sense of means of production and labour-power set in motion;
it is the *price of a claim* on future cash flows. In short: it is paper wealth whose valuation
is governed by conventions of expectation and discounting, even though the ultimate substance that can
validate those expectations is surplus value produced in the sphere of production.

The critical Marxian point is the macro-constraint: the expansion of fictitious capital can
run far ahead of the growth of surplus value actually produced and realised. Crises erupt when
the expectations embedded in $K_f$ become incompatible with the underlying capacity of production
and realisation to sustain those cash flows. Asset prices then fall sharply, destroying or
revaluing paper wealth, while leaving behind debts, unemployment, and social damage.

## Tech hype as a vehicle for speculative valuation

A contemporary cultural form of fictitious capital is techno-utopian speculation: venture-funded firms and their investors often sell not present profitability but stories about future monopoly positions and future command over revenue streams. Under conditions of weak productive profitability, capital
hunts for assets whose *valuation* can be pushed upward faster than any measured improvement
in everyday life. The point is not simply to sell a useful product; it is often to capitalise
an expectation of future revenue, lock in market power, and attract early entrants to a rising claim.

High-profile frauds are only the most visible edge of this logic. More commonly, we see cycles where
technologies are marketed as world-changing mainly because that narrative can justify venture capital,
inflate stock prices, or produce monopoly rents through patents, platforms, and gatekept access.
In this sense, techno-utopianism is not merely an idea; it is a *financial mechanism* that helps
convert uncertain futures into tradable claims in the present.

None of this implies that technological development is irrelevant. It implies that under capitalism
the dominant selector is not social need but expected profitability and controllable revenue streams.
That is why comparatively “boring” public goods—mass transit, universal sanitation, public housing,
open-access health systems, resilient grids—are chronically underbuilt, while speculative fantasies
can attract extraordinary funding. The difference is not technical feasibility alone; it is the
difference between what meets needs and what can be owned, priced, and capitalised.

## Example: real estate and speculation in Pakistan

In many parts of the global South, including Pakistan, the combination of
energy costs, infrastructural bottlenecks, political instability, and import
dependence has made productive investment risky. At the same time, property
speculation, urban land grabs, and financial arbitrage have offered
relatively easier gains for those with capital.[StrugglePK_TDR]

This pattern is inseparable from belated, uneven development and the structure of the state. Where local
capital has historically remained narrow, import- and contract-dependent, and politically risk-averse, it has
often failed to build an industrial base capable of absorbing labour at scale and raising productivity in a
broad, socially transformative way. In that vacuum, the most coherent and force-concentrated institutions of
the capitalist state can become not only coercive arbiters but also major economic organisers: they sit atop
land allocations, procurement chains, regulatory power, and the “security” framing through which budgets and
property regimes are protected. The point is not that such institutions are alien to the state, but that they
are *one of its central forms*—and, in crisis conditions, they can expand their economic footprint as
other fractions falter.

In that context, liberal hopes that rotating civilian parties will steadily produce a secular-democratic
modernisation run into a material barrier: the underlying property relations, the world-market constraint, and
the coercive apparatus that defends both. Without confronting those relations—especially land, finance,
strategic infrastructure, and the external discipline of debt and conditionality—electoral alternation tends
to reshuffle administrators while leaving the core drivers of speculation, informalisation, and repression
intact.[StrugglePK_WorldPerspectives,PeetUnholyTrinity]

This leads to:

- a misallocation of resources towards luxury housing, gated communities, and malls while basic manufacturing and public services are starved of investment;
- a reliance on imported goods and remittances, generating trade deficits and external debt; and
- rising land prices that push workers and peasants to the margins, deepening class and gendered burdens of social reproduction.

From a Marxian perspective, this is not an aberration but a variant of the
general tendency of capital to flee from the hard work of exploiting living
labour in production towards speculative claims on future surplus value.
