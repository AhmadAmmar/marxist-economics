# Crises, cycles, and unemployment

Mainstream economics often treats crises as the result of “shocks”: a bad
policy, a pandemic, an oil price spike. Marxian political economy instead
sees crises as **endogenous** to the system.

## Overaccumulation and overproduction

If profits fall in the productive sectors, capitalists may cut investment.
Yet credit and fictitious capital—stocks, bonds, derivatives, property
titles—can keep expanding claims on future surplus value even when the
underlying surplus is under strain.[HarveyNewImperialism]

At the same time, the drive to raise \exploitrate{} and cut costs means that
workers' wages grow slowly relative to productivity. The result is a chronic
tendency towards **overproduction**: more goods and services than can
be profitably sold at existing wages and power relations.

## The boom–bust rhythm

A highly simplified stylised cycle looks like this:

1. **Expansion**: Profits are high; firms invest; credit expands; employment rises.
2. **Overaccumulation**: Competition and rising \OCC{} squeeze profitability; inventories build up; debt burdens grow.
3. **Crisis**: Investment collapses; firms fail; banks curtail lending; unemployment rises; states respond with bailouts and austerity.
4. **Devaluation and restructuring**: Capital is destroyed or devalued; wages and working conditions are attacked; new technologies and organisational forms are introduced; profitability is partially restored.
5. **Renewed expansion**—until the next wave.

The Great Depression, the post-war boom, the profitability crisis of the
1970s, the global crisis of 2007–08, and the uneven post-COVID conjuncture
can all be read through this lens.[Roberts2015,HarveyCompanion]
