# Constant and variable capital; circuits of capital

To move from exploitation at the point of production to the dynamics of the
system as a whole, we need to distinguish types of capital.[Marx1867]

## Constant and variable capital

- **Constant capital** ($\constcap$) is the value of the means of production: machinery, buildings, raw materials, intermediate goods. Its value is *transferred* to the product but does not itself create new value.
- **Variable capital** ($\varcap$) is the value advanced to buy labour-power (wages, broadly understood). It is called “variable” because it is the part of capital that can create more value than it costs.

If we consider one turnover of capital, the **value** of the total
commodity product is:
\begin{equation}
  W = \constcap + \varcap + \surplus.
  
\end{equation}

The **cost price** for the capitalist is:
\begin{equation}
  k = \constcap + \varcap,
\end{equation}
while the surplus value $\surplus$ is the excess of value over cost.

### Why “selling above market price” cannot explain profit.

A common intuition is that profit comes from *selling dear*: buy for $100$, sell for $120$.
But as a general explanation of profit for the whole capitalist class, this cannot work.

**Example (1): pure price mark-up is redistribution, not creation.**
Suppose Merchant A buys a commodity for \$100 and sells it to Merchant B for \$120.
A gains \$20, but B has paid \$20 more than the prevailing market price. Across the two
merchants taken together, no new value is created *by this exchange*; \$20 has simply been
transferred from B to A. If *everyone* tried to “sell above market price” at the same time,
the “market price” would just re-set upward. The question would return in the same form:
where does the extra money come from *in the aggregate*?

**Example (2): profit without any mark-up.**
Now consider a capitalist who advances $\constcap=80$ for inputs and depreciation, and $\varcap=20$ in wages.
Living labour produces new value $\varcap+\surplus = 40$, so the commodity product has value
$$
W = \constcap + \varcap + \surplus = 80 + 20 + 20 = 120.
$$
If the capitalist sells the output *at its value* \$120 (no overcharging at all), the cost price is
$k=\constcap+\varcap=100$, so profit is
$$
W-k = 120-100=20,
$$
which is exactly the surplus value $\surplus$.

Selling above (or below) value can redistribute surplus value between capitals (as shown in
Section~sec:prices-production), especially under monopoly power. But the system-wide source of
profit is surplus value extracted from labour-power. Profit appears here even though the commodity is
sold at its value, because the source is the surplus value $s$ created in production.

With this cleared up, we can return to the movement of capital itself: how money is advanced, turned into means of production and labour-power, and then returns expanded as $M'$. This is what Marx captures in the basic circuits of circulation.

## Circuits of capital

Marx contrasts two circuits:

\begin{align}
  \CMC &: C \rightarrow M \rightarrow C,
  

  \MCM &: M \rightarrow C \rightarrow M'.
  
\end{align}

- In $C \rightarrow M \rightarrow C$, a small producer sells a commodity $C$ for money $M$ to buy another commodity $C$ (e.g.\ a farmer selling grain to buy tools and food). The goal is use-value.
- The same overall form also describes the *worker's* circuit, with an important twist. The worker does not usually sell a finished commodity they own; they sell their **labour-power** (the capacity to work for a period) for a money wage $M$. That wage is then spent to buy commodities $C$ needed to live and to return to work tomorrow—food, transport, rent, childcare, medicine, and so on. In that sense the wage is not payment for *all* the value the worker creates; it is the money form of the value of labour-power, i.e.\ the cost of reproducing the worker as a worker. This is why questions of households, care, and unpaid work (social reproduction) are not “outside” political economy: they are part of the conditions of possibility of wage-labour itself.
- This is also why money is not a neutral “medium” hovering above society. In capitalism it becomes the everyday form of constraint: you do not access housing, food, transport, care, or time directly; you access them *through wages*. Nature does not demand coins for land, water, or energy. The demand comes from property and enforcement: social structures that monopolise conditions of life and charge for entry. Money is therefore not merely a tool of exchange; it is the social form in which private control over social wealth confronts the majority as a daily requirement.
- In $M \rightarrow C \rightarrow M'$, a capitalist advances money $M$ to buy labour-power and means of production $C$, producing commodities that are sold for $M' = M + \Delta M$. The goal is the increment $\Delta M$, i.e.\ surplus value realised in money-form as profit.

Capital is therefore best understood not as a thing (a machine) but as a social relation and a circuit:
**value in motion that valorises itself through the exploitation of labour, and that necessarily appears
and is realised in monetary form as $M \rightarrow M'$.**
