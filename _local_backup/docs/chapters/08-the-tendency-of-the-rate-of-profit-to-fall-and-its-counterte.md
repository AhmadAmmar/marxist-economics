# The tendency of the rate of profit to fall and its countertendencies

Marx formulates the TRPF as a *tendency* of capitalist accumulation:[Marx1894,Roberts2015]

Marx argues that, *other things equal*, accumulation tends to raise the organic composition of capital:
more machinery, technology, and materials are set in motion per worker. Since only living labour produces
new value, a rising $c$ relative to $v$ tends, over long periods, to press down the rate of profit, unless
counter-tendencies (higher exploitation, cheapening of elements of constant capital, foreign trade, etc.)
offset it.

\begin{quote}
*“[T]he gradual growth of constant capital in relation to variable capital must necessarily lead to a
gradual fall of the general rate of profit \dots”*[Marx1894]
\end{quote}

The mathematics is compact in Eq.~\eqref{eq:profit-rate-occ}: if \OCC{} rises while $e$ is constant, then the rate of profit $r$ must fall. But Marx immediately adds that this tendency is modified by counteracting influences.

## Counteracting tendencies

Some of the main countertendencies are:

1. Raising the exploitation rate $\exploitrate$ by lengthening the working day, intensifying labour, or cutting the value of labour-power (e.g.\ through wage repression, union-busting, outsourcing, or attacks on social reproduction).[HarveyCompanion]
2. Cheapening elements of constant capital, so that $\constcap$ grows more slowly than productivity, for example through technological progress in the production of machines and raw materials.
3. Depressing wages below the value of labour-power, especially in the global South, migrant labour regimes, and informal sectors.
4. Expanding to new markets, new branches of production, and new forms of commodification (land, housing, health, education, data, platforms).
5. Destroying capital in crises (bankruptcies, write-offs, wars), which reduces the denominator $\constcap + \varcap$ and can temporarily restore profitability for surviving capitals.

These factors explain why capitalism can go through long booms despite the
underlying tendency. They do not abolish the law; they generate cycles and
waves.

## Empirical patterns

Empirical work by Marxist economists suggests that, across many advanced
capitalist economies, profitability tends to fall over long periods, interrupted
by partial recoveries, and that major crises are often preceded by profit
squeezes.[Roberts2015,Shaikh2016]

The details are debated, but the broader point is clear: capitalist firms
are structurally driven to raise \OCC{} via automation and capital intensity,
and this makes profitability increasingly fragile. When combined with high
debt levels and financial speculation, the outcome is recurrent crises.
