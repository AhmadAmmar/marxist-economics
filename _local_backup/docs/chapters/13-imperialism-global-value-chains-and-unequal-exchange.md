# Imperialism, global value chains, and unequal exchange

Capitalism has been global from early on. Marx wrote about world markets and
colonial plunder; later Marxists analysed imperialism as a stage where
capital exports, monopolies, and state power become central.[LeninImperialism,PatnaikImperialism]

Today, global value chains and unequal exchange structure the relation
between global North and South.

## Unequal exchange in practice

Consider again:

- garment workers in Bangladesh producing for fast-fashion brands headquartered in Europe; and
- electronics workers in East and Southeast Asia assembling devices for firms headquartered in the US, Japan, or South Korea.

Studies~[Smith2016,Hickel2022,DedrickKraemerLinden2010] of the cost structure of an iPhone or a pair of branded jeans show
that:

- direct manufacturing wages are often less than 5–10\% of the retail price;
- most of the surplus value is realised and appropriated in the centres of finance, marketing, and intellectual property; and
- Northern states and firms control key chokepoints: technology, finance, logistics, trade rules.[Smith2016,Hickel2022]

A growing portion of this power takes the form of **digital and intellectual-property enclosures**.
Patents, licensing, paywalls, proprietary platforms, and “terms of service” operate as mechanisms of monopoly
rent: they restrict access to knowledge and infrastructure that is socially produced, then charge for entry.
This is not a moral claim about individual consumers; it is a structural claim about ownership.
Under capitalism, even when the marginal cost of copying software, research, or cultural work is near zero,
property law is used to impose artificial scarcity so that revenue streams can be defended. This is a clear case where the use-value of knowledge—its capacity to be copied and shared at near-zero marginal cost—is subordinated to exchange-value through enforced exclusivity.

This matters for unequal exchange because it allows firms headquartered in the North to appropriate value
created across the world not only through manufacturing and trade, but through controlling chokepoints of
knowledge, standards, and access. The result is that Southern labour can produce, but Northern ownership can
capture: value creation is geographically distributed, while value appropriation is organised through
monopoly rights.

From a Marxian point of view, value is created wherever living labour is
expended, but the *distribution* of surplus value is shaped by power,
monopoly, and imperial structures. Unequal exchange is not simply about
unfair prices; it is a mechanism for sustained transfer of value from South
to North.

## Debt, austerity, and structural adjustment

Imperialist relations are reinforced through sovereign debt, IMF and World
Bank conditionalities, and trade agreements. Southern economies are pushed
towards export-oriented, low-wage specialisation, while austerity shrinks
public services and public employment.[StrugglePK_WorldPerspectives]

This directly affects class struggle: workers, peasants, and oppressed
genders face both the local bourgeoisie and global institutions as they fight
for wages, land, services, and democratic rights.
