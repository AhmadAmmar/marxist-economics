# Abstract and concrete labour; socially necessary labour time

Every act of labour is concrete: a nurse tending patients, a teacher
preparing a lesson, a coder debugging, a farmer transplanting rice seedlings.
Concrete labour produces specific use-values.

At the same time, under capitalism, labour also counts as an *abstract*
expenditure of human energy that can be compared across jobs: eight hours of
call-centre work and eight hours of garment stitching are treated as equal
quantities of homogeneous labour time on the market.

The reduction of concrete labour to abstract labour happens socially, behind
the backs of individuals, through the discipline of competition and the
wage relation. If a firm uses more labour time per unit than the social
average, it loses out.

We can formalise the idea of socially necessary labour time (SNLT) for a given
commodity $i$ as an output-weighted average over firms:

\begin{equation}
  \LSN{i} \approx
  \frac{\sum_{j=1}^{n} q_{ij}\,L_{ij}}{\sum_{j=1}^{n} q_{ij}},
  
\end{equation}

where $L_{ij}$ is the direct and indirect labour time *per unit* of commodity $i$
at firm $j$, measured at normal intensity and average skill for the period, and
$q_{ij}$ is firm $j$'s *socially realised* output of commodity $i$ in the period
(i.e.\ output that is validated in exchange). Competition tends to penalise high-$L_{ij}$
producers (those using more labour time per unit than the social average) through
profit squeezes and loss of market share, shifting production toward lower-$L_{ij}$
techniques and pulling the socially necessary time toward what is required under
prevailing, normal conditions. The precise social process is more complex, but the key
point is: value depends on the *average* conditions of production, not any individual
firm's whims.

If a new technology halves the labour time required while becoming the
industry norm, the value of the commodity falls—even if the selling price
only gradually adjusts.
