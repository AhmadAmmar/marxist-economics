# Policy fixes, reformism, and the capitalist veto

When crises intensify, politics usually floods with proposals that promise to stabilise capitalism without
touching ownership: raise the minimum wage, tax the rich, give everyone cash (UBI), print money (QE/MMT),
cancel debts, regulate monopolies, or build a “green” capitalism through carbon markets and climate finance.
Many of these measures can *matter* for living conditions, sometimes a great deal. The Marxian question is
more specific: *what kinds of contradictions can such measures actually resolve, and which ones do they
inevitably reproduce?*

To answer, we need one distinction.

### Reforms versus reformism.

A **reform** is a concrete gain won in struggle: higher wages, shorter hours, cheaper essentials, housing,
healthcare, democratic rights. Communists fight for such gains. **Reformism** is the belief that parliamentary
measures, taken as administrative policy inside unchanged property relations, can overcome capitalism's core laws
of motion: exploitation, profit-governed investment, overaccumulation, and crisis. The difference is strategic.
Reforms can improve life and build capacity. Reformism treats reforms as a substitute for confronting ownership
and class power.

### The capitalist veto (the structural core).

Under capitalism, the majority do not control production. Capital owns (or commands) workplaces, supply chains,
credit, land, and key infrastructures. Investment is not a neutral technical decision; it is governed by expected
profitability and risk. That means reforms that threaten profitability, discipline, or property are met not only
by debate in parliament but by a set of *structural responses* available to capital: layoffs, closures,
informalisation, subcontracting, relocation, price hikes where market power allows, capital flight into dollars or
property, accounting tricks, lobbying, court action, and media and state sabotage. This is the “capital strike”
dynamic: when private owners control investment, they can withhold it.

This is not a moral claim about individual bosses. It is a claim about a system in which production is privately
controlled and social reproduction is forced to pass through money and markets. With that clarity, we can assess
the most common policy fixes.

**“But where would the money come from?” Money versus provisioning.**

A recurring objection to universal services, public housing, free transit, or healthcare is:
“Where would the money come from?” Marxian political economy answers by separating
*money as an accounting and command device* from *the real conditions of provisioning*.
The material question is not whether society can print tokens, but whether society can organise
labour, land, energy, machinery, and logistics to produce and distribute use-values.

Under capitalism, money appears as the gatekeeper to food, homes, medicine, and education because
access is controlled by property, prices, and profitability. Nature does not demand payment for
land, water, or sunlight. The demand comes from social power: private ownership, state enforcement,
and corporate control, which turn conditions of life into commodities. Once essentials are treated as
social wealth—planned and provided as rights—“funding” stops being a mystical problem and becomes
a practical one: how much capacity exists, what inputs and labour are required, what timelines are
feasible, and which priorities society sets under democratic control.

## Minimum wage: why a good law meets a structural constraint

Consider a large legal increase in the minimum wage, for example a guaranteed living wage. On paper this is a gain.
But the law immediately collides with the relation developed earlier: labour-power is purchased as *variable
capital* $v$, and surplus value $s$ is extracted in production. If the wage floor rises, and if output prices and
productivity are unchanged, then $v$ rises relative to $s$, and the rate of profit
$$
r=\frac{s}{c+v}
$$
is pushed downward. Capital therefore tries to restore profitability through mechanisms it controls:

- **Evasion and informalisation:** shifting workers off contracts, underreporting hours, using subcontractors, replacing formal jobs with informal or gig arrangements.
- **Layoffs and closures:** threatening job cuts or shutdowns, especially in low-margin sectors or where employers can easily switch locations or lines of business.
- **Speed-up and intensification:** raising the pace of work, cutting breaks, increasing output norms so that each paid hour yields more surplus in practice (a rise in the realised exploitation rate).
- **Price pass-through where possible:** raising prices in sectors with market power, turning part of the wage gain into higher living costs, especially when essentials are privately priced.
- **Recomposition of investment:** moving into speculative outlets (property, currency arbitrage, rent-seeking) if productive profitability is weak or contested.

None of this implies that minimum-wage struggles are pointless. It implies that a wage reform, by itself, does not
command production. It has to be paired with enforcement, organisation, and measures that limit capital's ability to
evade, relocate, or recapture the gain through prices and intensified labour. The stronger the labour movement and
the more socialised the provision of essentials (housing, transport, healthcare, energy), the more durable a wage gain
can become.

## Progressive taxation: redistribution meets capital mobility and state dependence

Progressive taxation is another common solution: tax profits, wealth, and high incomes to fund social spending. From a
Marxian perspective, the first point is simple: taxes do not abolish exploitation; they redistribute claims on social
output *after* production and appropriation have already occurred. That redistribution can still be socially vital.
But its limits are structural.

First, capital has multiple routes of resistance: avoidance and evasion, hiding assets, shifting profits, moving money
offshore, and reclassifying income. Where the tax state is weak, and where large sectors are informal, taxation tends to
fall back onto indirect taxes and wage earners while wealth escapes. Second, the capitalist state itself is structurally
pressured to maintain “investment” and “confidence”: it needs employment, revenues, foreign exchange, and credit
access. Without controls on capital movement and strong enforcement capacity, progressive taxation becomes a terrain of
class struggle, not a purely administrative adjustment.

So the Marxian point is not “taxation never helps.” It is: taxation that seriously threatens capitalist income and
property tends to trigger a confrontation with capital's structural power. If that confrontation is not met with organised
power and controls over finance and investment, redistribution is diluted, reversed, or captured.

## UBI: cash without decommodification

A universal basic income (UBI) proposes unconditional cash payments. In principle, it can reduce poverty and provide
a survival floor. The Marxian question is: does a cash grant decommodify life, or does it become another money stream
circulating inside the same commodity economy?

If essentials remain commodified and privately priced, a cash grant can be partially captured by landlords, private
utilities, and monopolised suppliers through higher rents and administered prices. In that case UBI risks functioning
as an indirect subsidy to low-wage capital and rentiers: wages can be held down while the state tops up survival in cash.
UBI also faces a funding constraint that immediately becomes political: it must be financed by taxing capital/wealth,
cutting other spending, borrowing (state debt), or monetary expansion. Each route collides with class power under
capitalism: capital resists taxation, borrowing shifts today's conflict into a claim on *future* surplus, and money
creation in an import-dependent, price-sensitive economy can return as inflation or currency pressure.

The most robust version of “basic income” therefore tends to be not cash alone but **universal basic services**:
socialised housing, transport, energy, healthcare, education, and care. These are not simply moral add-ons; they reduce
capital's ability to recapture wage gains and cash transfers through prices, and they shift part of social reproduction
out of the market.

## Quantitative easing and “printing money”: expanding claims versus producing value

Quantitative easing (QE) and related “print money” proposals are often framed as a technical solution: if the state can
create money, why not fund jobs, services, and investment directly? Marxian political economy begins by separating two
things: *money as a claim* and *value as socially necessary labour time* expressed in money form.

QE is best understood as a state-led intervention that supports financial balance sheets by purchasing assets and
creating liquidity. It can lower interest rates and stabilise banks. But it does not, by itself, set additional labour
to work in productive processes that generate surplus value. In Marxian terms it supports and revalues *titles* to
future income, i.e.\ fictitious capital, without guaranteeing an expansion of surplus value actually produced. When
profitability is weak, QE therefore commonly shows up as asset-price inflation and the preservation of financial wealth,
rather than as a transformation of everyday life.

More generally, monetary expansion can relax constraints, but it cannot abolish the basic contradiction that the mass of
profits and interest-bearing claims must be validated by production and realisation. Where supply is constrained, imports
are decisive, or oligopolies dominate essentials, money injections can reappear as price inflation and renewed class
discipline. The question is not whether money can be created, but who controls production, pricing, and allocation.

## Job guarantees and Keynesian stimulus: demand management without investment control

A Job Guarantee (JG) or large fiscal stimulus is often posed as an alternative to UBI: instead of paying people to exist,
the state directly employs them and stabilises demand. Such measures can reduce unemployment and build useful infrastructure.
But they still confront capitalist investment control. If the private sector retains command over major production, credit,
and trade, then sustained full employment and rising wage power can provoke inflation politics, investment strikes, and
pressure for austerity and “discipline.” In other words, demand management can moderate the cycle, but it cannot remove
the profitability and overaccumulation pressures that repeatedly drive capitalist crises unless it is paired with democratic
control over investment and strategic sectors.

This is a recurring pattern: the state can absorb some unemployment and fund projects, but if capital remains free to
withhold investment, relocate, or raise prices, the system fights back against reforms that shift power to labour.

## Debt relief, jubilees, and bailouts: revaluing claims without transforming production

Debt relief can be necessary. In a debt-driven economy, households, firms, and states can become locked into servicing
claims that are no longer compatible with living standards and productive capacity. From a Marxian standpoint, debt is a
structured claim on future surplus. Writing down debts therefore revalues claims on future surplus—it is a moment of
devaluation and restructuring. The class question is: *whose claims are protected and whose lives are sacrificed?*

Bailouts that protect banks and bondholders while imposing austerity on workers preserve fictitious capital and restore the
discipline of repayment. Jubilees that relieve households can materially help, but without socialising finance and controlling
credit allocation, the debt machine tends to rebuild itself through new lending, asset bubbles, and renewed extraction.

Debt relief is therefore best understood not as a final solution but as a terrain of struggle over who bears crisis costs,
and whether finance remains a private power or is brought under democratic control.

## “Green capitalism”: carbon markets, offsets, ESG, and climate finance

The dominant ruling-class response to ecological crisis increasingly takes the form of “green capitalism”: carbon pricing,
offset markets, ESG metrics, green bonds, and climate-finance instruments. Some of these measures can shift relative prices
and force limited disclosures. But they also tend to reproduce the deeper contradiction: capitalism treats ecological repair
as a new field for profitable claims, rents, and enclosures.

Carbon markets and offsets can convert the atmosphere and land-use into tradable assets, producing new revenue streams for
consultancies, financiers, and land intermediaries. ESG and climate finance can become reputational and financial screens
that reprice assets without guaranteeing absolute reductions in extraction and throughput. In Marxian terms, these strategies
often create new layers of fictitious capital and rent extraction on top of an accumulation process that still requires
expansion, competitiveness, and cost-cutting. The result can be a “green” veneer that leaves the compulsion to grow and to
externalise ecological costs intact.

A socialist approach begins from a different premise: ecological transition is a planning problem, not primarily a pricing
problem. It requires deliberate decisions about what to phase out, what to build, and how to allocate labour, energy, and
materials under democratic control. That, in turn, requires confronting ownership in energy, transport, housing, land, and
finance.

## Regulation-only fixes: antitrust and “better governance”

Finally, there are proposals that aim to civilise capitalism through regulation: antitrust, platform rules, transparency,
corporate governance reform. Such measures can curb specific abuses. But they do not abolish exploitation, competition, or
the profit imperative. Monopolies and oligopolies are not just policy accidents; they are recurrent outcomes of accumulation,
concentration, and control over chokepoints (land, finance, logistics, intellectual property). Regulation can change tactics.
It does not remove the underlying compulsion that drives the system toward crisis and toward new forms of domination.

## The general point: what these fixes can and cannot do

The common thread is not that reforms are irrelevant. It is that reforms which act mainly on *distribution*,
*circulation*, or *regulation*, while leaving the ownership and control of production intact, cannot eliminate the
contradictions generated by accumulation itself. They can manage symptoms, redistribute some pain, and win real improvements.
But they also tend to trigger counter-moves by capital (price recapture, disinvestment, informalisation, financial speculation)
and by the state (austerity, “confidence” politics, repression) unless they are backed by organised power and structural
measures that neutralise the capitalist veto.

This is why crisis management so often feeds directly into financialisation (the next section): when productive profitability
is weak and deeper transformations are blocked, the system leans harder on credit, asset prices, and speculative claims.

## Reforms as struggle: making gains durable by confronting power

Communists therefore fight on two levels at once.

First, we fight for immediate reforms that materially improve life: higher wages, shorter hours, strong labour rights, and
universal provision of essentials. These struggles build organisation and confidence, and they expose the real lines of power.

Second, we insist that making such gains *durable* requires confronting the capitalist veto. In practice, that points
toward measures such as:

- **decommodifying essentials** through universal basic services (housing, healthcare, education, transport, energy, water, care), so wage gains and cash transfers are not immediately recaptured by rents and prices;
- **capital controls and financial regulation with teeth**, so investment strikes and capital flight are not the automatic response to popular reforms;
- **socialising key sectors** (especially finance, energy, transport, and strategic supply chains) so credit and investment can be directed by democratic priorities rather than private profit;
- **workers' organisation and workplace power** (unions, shopfloor committees, collective bargaining, the right to strike), without which reforms become paper promises;
- **ecological planning** that treats decarbonisation and adaptation as deliberate social projects, not as markets for offsets and speculative green assets.

In short: reforms matter, but reformism fails. Parliamentary measures can win real improvements, but the system's contradictions
are rooted in production and property relations. To move beyond recurring crisis, society must bring investment, production, and
the conditions of life under democratic control. That is the horizon that gives reform struggles their strategic direction.
