# Social reproduction, unpaid labour, and gender

Class struggle does not occur only in the workplace. The reproduction of labour-power—the everyday and
generational work of keeping human beings alive, functional, and able to return to work—is itself a
site of struggle. This includes feeding, cleaning, rest and recovery, caring for children and elders,
emotional support, maintaining social ties, and community organising. It also includes the broader
social conditions that make labour-power available at all: housing, water, transport, schooling,
healthcare, and safety, whether provided privately in households, collectively in communities, or through
the state.

Capitalism depends on this reproductive work, but it does not automatically pay for it. The wage is the
money-form of the value of labour-power—the portion of social labour that reproduces the worker—yet
much of the work that actually reproduces labour-power is displaced onto households, disproportionately
onto women and marginalised genders, and onto racialised and migrant workers in low-paid “care” and
service sectors. Feminist Marxists speak of **social reproduction** to name this terrain: the
interlinked processes through which labour-power is produced, maintained, repaired, and renewed as a
condition for capitalist production.[BhattacharyaSRT,FedericiCaliban]

This matters politically because it changes what we count as “economic.” If the workplace is one
frontline of exploitation, the household and community are another frontline where the costs of that
exploitation are absorbed, managed, and fought over. When public services are cut, when inflation hits
food and rent, when care is privatised, when migration regimes split families, or when violence and
criminalisation target gendered survival, the pressure shows up as longer unpaid hours, worse health,
and tighter control over bodies and time. Social reproduction is therefore not a “side issue” to class
politics; it is one of the main ways class power is organised and contested.

## Unpaid and underpaid labour

Much of the labour required to maintain and reproduce **labour-power** is unpaid or severely
underpaid, and it is disproportionately carried by women and marginalised genders. By “reproduction of
labour-power” we mean not only keeping individual workers going day to day (food, rest, care, recovery),
but also the broader reproduction of the working class across time (child-rearing, education, health,
and the everyday social supports that make life possible). This includes:

- domestic work in the household (cleaning, cooking, fetching water, managing the home);
- care work in families and communities (childcare, elder care, disability care, emotional labour, mutual aid);
- informal labour in home-based piecework, subsistence agriculture, and street vending;
- paid but low-waged reproductive/service work (domestic work, cleaning, nursing, teaching assistants, care homes), often done by migrant and racialised workers under coercive conditions;
- **intimate and sexual labour**, including sex work, which is frequently shaped by patriarchal violence, poverty, policing, and stigma. Where it is criminalised, workers face heightened exploitation and risk, and the boundary between “consent” and coercion is materially structured by survival, debt, and state repression.

Capital benefits from this arrangement because it can pay wages that cover only part of the true social
cost of reproducing labour-power. The missing costs do not disappear; they are shifted onto households,
onto unpaid time, onto stretched public services, and onto the bodies of those made responsible for care.
When that burden becomes intolerable, it becomes a site of struggle: demands for childcare, housing,
healthcare, shorter hours, safer workplaces, decriminalisation and labour rights, and collective provision
are not “add-ons” to class politics but part of the fight over how labour-power is reproduced and who
pays for it.

## A broader view of class struggle

Struggles over public services, housing, food prices, and gendered violence
are thus *also* class struggles. They contest who pays the costs of
reproducing labour-power: capital, the state, households, or communities.

For example:

- When austerity cuts public healthcare, the burden shifts onto unpaid carers (mostly women).
- When housing is financialised and rents soar, workers must spend more of their wages on shelter, effectively raising necessary labour time and pressuring exploitation.

Marxian political economy enriched by social reproduction theory therefore
links factory, office, and platform struggles with feminist, queer, and
anti-racist movements.[BhattacharyaSRT]
