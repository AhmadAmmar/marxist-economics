# Labour-power, wages, surplus labour, and surplus value

A central conceptual breakthrough in *Capital* is the distinction between
**labour** and **labour-power**.[Marx1867]

- **Labour-power** is the worker's capacity to work, treated as a commodity. Its value is the SNLT embodied in the worker's means of subsistence: food, housing, clothing, education, healthcare, social support.
- **Labour** is the actual activity performed during the working day.

The capitalist buys labour-power for a wage, but receives labour itself. The
secret of profit lies in the difference between the value produced by labour
and the value of labour-power.

## What the worker sells: labour-power, not labour

In everyday speech we say workers “sell their labour.” Marx insists this is
misleading. What workers sell is *labour-power*: the capacity to work for a
given time under the employer’s control.

That distinction is not a semantic trick; it is the logical key. If workers sold
*labour itself* as a commodity, then its price (the wage) would have to equal
the value labour produces. Profit would be impossible except by cheating.

Under capitalism, the wage can be an *equivalent* exchange even while exploitation
occurs, because the exchange is:
$$
\text{wage} \longleftrightarrow \text{labour-power for } T \text{ hours},
$$
and the *use-value* of labour-power is precisely that it can create new value
during those $T$ hours. The capitalist pays for the reproduction cost of that capacity
(the value of labour-power), but purchases control over its use in production for the
whole working day.

So the contract is for *labour-power*, not labour itself. This distinction is the
hinge of the pamphlet: it lets us explain exploitation without assuming cheating, and it
lets us define $v$ and $s$ in a way that maps directly onto the working day.

In Marx’s shorthand, $v$ (variable capital) is the value advanced as wages to buy
labour-power. When labour-power is put to work for the full $T$ hours, it creates new
value greater than $v$. The portion of new value that merely replaces the wage is
*necessary labour* (corresponding to $v$), while the remaining portion is
*surplus value* $s$, the money-form of unpaid surplus labour time.

We can now state this in the simplest temporal form: split the working day into the portion that
reproduces the wage and the portion that produces surplus.

## Necessary and surplus labour time

Assume the worker is paid the full value of labour-power, $v$ (no cheating). In
production, living labour adds new value; call the new value created in the day
$(v+s)$. Since the capitalist owns the product, the worker receives $v$ while the
remainder $s$ is appropriated as surplus-value. The puzzle is resolved: equal
exchange in the wage contract is compatible with exploitation because the use-value
of labour-power is value-creating labour.

Let the working day be $T$ hours. Suppose the value of the worker’s labour-power
corresponds to $\Tn$ hours of labour—the *necessary* labour time. The
remaining
\begin{equation}
  \Ts = T - \Tn,
  
\end{equation}
is *surplus labour time*, during which the worker produces value for the
capitalist without equivalent wages.

The new value created in the day is proportional to $T$, but the worker is only
paid for $\Tn$. The surplus value is proportional to $\Ts$:
$$
v \propto \Tn,
  \qquad
  s \propto \Ts.
$$

We can therefore capture the rate of surplus value, or *rate of
exploitation*, as
\begin{equation}
  e = \frac{s}{v} = \frac{\Ts}{\Tn},
  
\end{equation}
because the proportionality factors cancel when we take the ratio.

Here, $v$ is the value of variable capital—the wages advanced—and $s$ is the
surplus value extracted.

## Why surplus necessarily appears once labour-power is commodified

Now we can state the logic in one chain.

Let the money-value created per hour of socially necessary labour be $\MELT$ (money/hour).
If the working day lasts $T$ hours, then the new value created in the day is:
$$
\text{new value} = \MELT \, T.
$$
If the value of labour-power corresponds to $\Tn$ hours of socially necessary labour,
then the wage (variable capital) corresponds to:
$$
v = \MELT \, \Tn.
$$
But the capitalist has purchased control over labour-power for the *whole* day $T$,
so the surplus value is the difference:
\begin{align*}
  s
  &= \MELT \, T \;-\; \MELT \, \Tn 

  &= \MELT \, (T - \Tn) 

  &= \MELT \, \Ts.
\end{align*}
So $s$ is not a moral hypothesis; it is the quantitative expression of surplus labour
time, mediated through money.

This is why Marx insists on the labour / labour-power distinction: without it, you
cannot explain profit *as a normal outcome of equivalent exchange*.

## Is this “theft”? Contract, coercion, and property relations

It is tempting to describe surplus value as “wage theft.” Sometimes employers
*do* literally steal wages (illegal non-payment). But Marx’s concept of exploitation
is deeper than that.

None of this denies *illegal* wage theft (non-payment, underpayment, forced overtime without pay, etc.). Those are real and widespread. The point here is analytical: even if every boss paid exactly what the law and contract stipulate, exploitation would still occur so long as labour-power is bought as a commodity and the product is owned by capital. The core problem is not a defective contract; it is the property relation that makes the contract necessary in the first place.

In the normal case, exploitation does not require the capitalist to cheat the worker
at the point of exchange.

The wage contract can be formally voluntary and “fair” in the sense that the worker is paid the value of labour-power.
The point, as shown in Section~sec:labourpower-not-labour, is that exploitation is compatible with equivalent exchange
because capital purchases control over labour-power for the whole working day, not the value the worker will create.

The coercion is *structural*: workers are separated from the means of production
and must sell labour-power to live. Because capital owns the workplace, machines, land,
and inputs, it also owns the product and the surplus. That is why exploitation is a
property relation reproduced daily through “free” contracts.

So the Marxian claim is:
- exploitation is not primarily a matter of bad individuals stealing;
- it is a normal outcome of capitalist production once labour-power is a commodity;
- therefore it cannot be abolished by moral appeals or contract reform alone, while the wage relation and private ownership of the main means of production remain.

This is exactly why the horizon of struggle is not only better terms inside the wage
relation, but ultimately the abolition of the wage relation itself.

## Example: a coffee-shop worker

Consider a barista in a large coffee chain in a global North city.

!!! example "Example"
    [A coffee-shop worker]
    Suppose:

    - The shop sells drinks and snacks worth \$800 during an 8-hour shift.
    - Of this, \$300 covers the value of used-up constant capital (beans, milk, cups, energy, machine depreciation) — this is $\constcap$.
    - The barista's wage bill for the shift is \$100 — this is $\varcap$.

    We want to find:

    - the new value created by living labour during the shift ($\varcap + \surplus$),
    - the surplus value $\surplus$,
    - the rate of exploitation $\exploitrate$, and
    - how many hours of the 8-hour day are necessary labour time and how many are surplus labour time.

    \subsubsection*{Step 1: Separate the value created by labour from the value of used-up machinery and inputs}

    The total value of the day's output is \$800.  Of this, \$300 is just the value of
    used-up constant capital $\constcap$ being transferred to the finished products.
    The remainder must therefore be new value created by living labour:
    \begin{align*}
      \text{Total value of output} &= \$800,

      \text{Value of used-up constant capital } (\constcap) &= \$300,\$$
    0.5em]
      \Rightarrow\quad
      \text{New value created by labour } (\varcap + \surplus)
        &= \text{Total value} - \text{Constant capital}

        &= \$800 - \$300

        &= \$500.
    \end{align*}
    So the labour of the barista has added \$500 of new value during the shift:
    $$
    \varcap + \surplus = \$500.
    $$

    \subsubsection*{Step 2: Split this new value into wages and surplus-value}

    Out of this \$500 of new value, the capitalist pays the barista \$100 as wages.
    This \$100 is the value of variable capital $\varcap$:
    $$
    \varcap = \$100.
    $$
    The rest of the new value is surplus-value $\surplus$:
    \begin{align*}
      \surplus
        &= (\varcap + \surplus) - \varcap

        &= \$500 - \$100

        &= \$400.
    \end{align*}
    So
    $$
    \surplus = \$400.
    $$

    \subsubsection*{Step 3: Compute the rate of exploitation}

    The *rate of exploitation* (or *rate of surplus-value*) is defined as
    the ratio of surplus-value to variable capital:
    $$
    \exploitrate = \frac{\surplus}{\varcap}.
    $$
    Plugging in our numbers:
    \begin{align*}
      \exploitrate
        &= \frac{\surplus}{\varcap}\$$
    0.3em]
        &= \frac{\$400}{\$100}\$$
    0.3em]
        &= 4.
    \end{align*}
    As a percentage:
    $$
    \exploitrate = 4 \times 100\% = 400\%.
    $$
    This means that, measured in value terms, the barista produces four times as
    much surplus for the owner as they receive back in wages.

    \subsubsection*{Step 4: Translate the value relations into hours of the working day}

    The barista works an 8-hour shift.  We know that, in value terms,
    $$
    \varcap : \surplus = 100 : 400 = 1 : 4.
    $$
    So, of the *new* value (\$500) created in the day, one-fifth belongs to
    necessary labour (reproducing the wage) and four-fifths is surplus labour.

    Necessary labour time is therefore one-fifth of the working day:
    \begin{align*}
      \text{Necessary labour time}
        &= \frac{\varcap}{\varcap + \surplus} \times 8\ \text{hours}\$$
    0.3em]
        &= \frac{100}{500} \times 8\$$
    0.3em]
        &= 0.2 \times 8\$$
    0.3em]
        &= 1.6\ \text{hours}.
    \end{align*}
    The remaining part of the working day is surplus labour time:
    \begin{align*}
      \text{Surplus labour time}
        &= 8\ \text{hours} - 1.6\ \text{hours}\$$
    0.3em]
        &= 6.4\ \text{hours}.
    \end{align*}

    So in this simple coffee-shop example:

    - In the first $1.6$ hours of the shift, the barista produces value equivalent to their own wage (necessary labour time).
    - In the remaining $6.4$ hours, they produce surplus-value for the owner (surplus labour time).
    - Over the whole day, the rate of exploitation is $\exploitrate = 400\%$: for every \$1 paid in wages, \$4 of surplus-value is extracted.

    This does *not* mean that the branch manager personally pockets
    \$400. The surplus value is divided, through complex mechanisms, into
    different forms of revenue: profit of enterprise, interest on loans,
    rent to the landlord, franchise fees to the global brand, and taxes to
    the state. Marx’s key point is that all of these streams ultimately
    originate in unpaid surplus labour time like that of this barista.

## Forms of wages: time-wages and piece-wages

Marx treats wages not only as a magnitude ($v$) but also as a *form* that can
conceal exploitation.[Marx1867] Two classic forms are time-wages and piece-wages.

\subsubsection*{Time-wages}

Under **time-wages**, the worker is paid per unit of time (hour/day/week/month).
Let the money wage per hour be $w_h$ and the paid hours in the period be $T$.
Then the *money wage bill* is
$$
W_w = w_h \, T.
$$

Time-wages make it appear as if the worker is paid for *all* labour performed in
those hours. But in Marxian terms, the wage is the price of *labour-power*, not the
price of *labour*. What is purchased is the worker's capacity to labour for $T$
hours under capital's control. The wage corresponds (in value terms) to $v$, the value of
labour-power, i.e.\ the socially necessary labour time required to reproduce the worker.

To connect money-wages to labour-time, introduce the monetary expression of labour time
(MELT), $\MELT$ (money per hour of socially necessary labour time). Then the value of
labour-power corresponds to a quantity of necessary labour time $\Tn$, and (schematically)
$$
v = \MELT \, \Tn,
  \qquad
  W_w \approx v.
$$

The approximation sign here flags that money-wages and market prices do not, in general,
equal values. Section~sec:prices-production explains how competition and the tendency
toward an average rate of profit generate prices of production that systematically diverge
from values; market power, state policy, and world-market (exchange-rate and terms-of-trade)
conditions can produce further, conjunctural deviations. The key point is conceptual: even
if $W_w$ equals the value of labour-power (no cheating), exploitation can still occur because
the use-value of labour-power is value-creating labour for a longer working day than $\Tn$.

\subsubsection*{Piece-wages}

Under **piece-wages**, the worker is paid per unit output. Let output per hour be
$q$ units/hour and the piece rate be $w_p$ money/unit. Then hourly pay is:
$$
w_h = w_p \, q
  \qquad\Rightarrow\qquad
  w_p = \frac{w_h}{q}.
$$
Marx’s key point is that piece-wages are not a different substance of payment: they are
*time-wages in disguise*. The piece-rate is derived from an assumed *normal* output
per unit time (a socially enforced “standard” pace of work), and the worker is then pushed
to meet or exceed that norm. Piece-wages therefore do not abolish time-wages; they are typically
a *modified* time-wage in which the wage is tied more directly to labour intensity and output.
In practice, this form often sharpens managerial control: it individualises pay, intensifies labour,
and can shift risks of stoppages, defects, and speed-up onto workers, while leaving the basic relation
unchanged—labour-power is still bought for a period, and surplus labour can still be extracted within
(or by extending) the working day.

\subsubsection*{Why this matters}

Piece-wages tend to:
- intensify labour (workers self-discipline to increase $q$);
- shift monitoring costs from management to workers (“the numbers” police you);
- increase competition among workers and weaken collective pacing and breaks.

But the underlying relation remains: the worker produces new value during the whole
working day, while the wage corresponds to the value of labour-power. Wage-forms alter
how exploitation is *experienced*, enforced, and fought over; they do not abolish
the exploitation relation itself.

## Example: smartphone assembly

### Note on values and prices.

For simplicity in these numerical examples, treat observed money prices and costs as
proportional to underlying values. In reality, prices can systematically deviate from
values through competition and the redistribution of surplus value via prices of
production; see Section~sec:prices-production. Market power, state policy, and
world-market conditions can generate further deviations around these regulating prices.

Return to the smartphone example. Suppose a batch of phones sells for
\$1.4 million. The costs are:

- $\constcap = \$1{,}000{,}000$ in components, depreciation, logistics.
- $\varcap = \$200{,}000$ in direct wages at the assembly plant.

If the phones sell for \$1.4 million, the surplus value *realised* on this batch is
\begin{equation}
  \surplus = \$1{,}400{,}000 - (\$1{,}000{,}000 + \$200{,}000) = \$200{,}000.
\end{equation}

The exploitation rate for the assembly labour (in this simplified example) is
\begin{equation}
  \exploitrate = \frac{\surplus}{\varcap}
  = \frac{\$200{,}000}{\$200{,}000} = 1 \quad\Rightarrow\quad \exploitrate = 100\%.
\end{equation}

Two cautions matter for Marxian precision.

First, this arithmetic treats money magnitudes as proportional to values for clarity.
In reality, competition, productivity differentials, and market power generate systematic
value–price divergences (see Section~sec:prices-production); we flag this here but
abstract from those divergences in the worked numbers.

Second, surplus value is produced where *productive labour* is set to work in production
processes that create commodities (or commodity-services) for sale. Much of what happens
“downstream” (advertising, branding, some retail functions, finance) is better analysed as
the *realisation* and *redistribution* of surplus value rather than its direct
production. The brand and its shareholders can nonetheless capture surplus generated across
the global chain through control of intellectual property, market access, finance, logistics,
and pricing power (including transfer pricing and monopoly rents).[Smith2016,Hickel2022]
