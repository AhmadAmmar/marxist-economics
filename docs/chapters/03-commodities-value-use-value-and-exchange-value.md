# Commodities, value, use-value, and exchange-value

Marx opens *Capital* with the line that the wealth of societies where the
capitalist mode of production rules appears as an “immense collection of
commodities”.[Marx1867] A **commodity** is, at minimum:

1. a useful thing (**use-value**); and
2. produced for exchange, not direct use (**exchange-value**).

A handmade meal cooked by you at home for yourself is not a commodity; the
same meal produced in a commercial kitchen and sold through a delivery app
is.

## Use-value

Use-value is about the concrete usefulness of a thing: food nourishes, a
phone enables communication, a medicine treats a disease. Use-values are
qualitative and historically varied. They exist in all societies.

## Exchange-value

Exchange-value is the quantitative relation in which one commodity exchanges
for another on the market: one coat for twenty metres of linen, one hour of a
developer's labour for a certain wage, one laptop for a certain sum of
money. In capitalist societies, this relation is typically expressed in money.

Money and markets can exist in many kinds of society; merchants traded, coins circulated,
and taxes or tribute were sometimes paid in money long before capitalism. In many pre-capitalist
settings exchange was episodic, bounded by custom, tribute, or status, and money did not function
as a universal mediator of everyday life. Large parts of life were organised through direct
obligation and production for use (rent in kind, customary dues, corv\'ee labour, household and
village production), with commodity exchange often limited or secondary to these relations.
Capitalism generalises commodity exchange so that money becomes the *universal equivalent*:
most goods and services are routinely bought and sold, and survival itself depends on access to money.
That is why under capitalism the typical question is not only *what* is produced, but
*what can be sold*, and for how much—including the selling of labour-power for wages.

When exchange-value is expressed in money, it appears as a **price**; later we return
to why prices do not always coincide with underlying values.

What interests Marx is: *what regulates these exchange ratios over the
long run*? Why does a high-end smartphone sell for many times the price of a
sack of rice, even though rice is more essential to life?

## Labour and value

Marx's answer is the \LTV. Very roughly, the value of a commodity grows in
proportion to the amount of socially necessary labour time it takes to make it.

\begin{equation}
  \Vi{i} = \MELT\,\LSN{i},
\end{equation}

where:
- $\Vi{i}$ is the value (in money terms) of *one unit* of commodity $i$;
- $\LSN{i}$ is the *socially necessary labour time* required to produce one unit of commodity $i$: that is, the labour time needed under *average* conditions of production, with average skill and intensity, using the prevailing technology; and
- $\MELT$ is the **monetary expression of labour time** (MELT): a proportionality constant that converts labour-time into money magnitudes, i.e.\ the amount of money that corresponds to one hour of socially necessary labour time in a given country and period (money per hour of \snlt).

We formalise \snlt{} as a social average across producers in Section~sec:abstract-concrete (Eq.~\eqref{eq:snlt}).

A further clarification is needed. The labour-time that regulates value is *social*
labour reduced to a common unit of **simple labour**. Concrete labours differ in
skill, training, and intensity; Marx treats *complex* (skilled) labour as
*multiplied simple labour*—that is, one hour of skilled labour counts as several
hours of average labour. Capitalism performs this reduction in practice behind our backs,
through training costs (often borne by households and the state), wage hierarchies, and
competitive norms that define what counts as “average” labour in each branch.

If a certain smartphone model typically takes $4$ hours of direct and indirect labour
time across the global supply chain (direct assembly labour plus the labour embodied in
parts, transport, and logistics), and a basic T-shirt takes $0.5$ hours, then the ratio
of their values (and thus their exchange-values in the value-theoretic sense) will tend,
other things equal, to be about
$$
\frac{\Vi{\text{phone}}}{\Vi{\text{shirt}}}
  = \frac{\MELT\,\LSN{\text{phone}}}{\MELT\,\LSN{\text{shirt}}}
  \approx \frac{4}{0.5} = 8,
$$
so the phone’s exchange-value tends to be about eight times the shirt’s (an $8{:}1$ ratio).

Market prices fluctuate around these values due to supply, demand, speculation, brand
power, and state policy, but in Marx's framework the underlying regulator of prices over
the long run is labour time *through competition and the formation of prices of production* (see Section~sec:prices-production).
In other words, value does not appear on the surface as a direct “price tag”: it asserts itself
through competitive pressures, productivity differences, and the redistribution of surplus value
across capitals.

## Nature, wealth, and the source of value

A common confusion (especially in climate politics) is to say: “If nature is essential,
then nature must be the source of value.” Marx’s position is more precise.

- **Nature is indispensable to production**: it provides materials, energy flows, ecosystems, and conditions of life. Without nature there is no labour process and no material wealth.
- **Nature is a source of use-values (material wealth)**: some use-values exist with little or no human labour (sunlight, air, wild fish), while most are produced by labour working on nature.
- **Value** (in the Marxian sense) is a *social form* specific to generalised commodity production: it is labour-time that society is compelled to treat as commensurable through exchange, regulated by **socially necessary labour time** and expressed in money.

So Marx does not deny nature. He is distinguishing categories. Nature helps determine *how much*
labour is required (by shaping productivity conditions and material inputs), but under capitalism it is
labour-time that appears *as value* in the dominant social accounting of wealth.

This distinction matters because capitalism can *increase* physical throughput and ecological harm
while *reducing* the value embodied per unit (if productivity rises and \snlt{} falls). In other words:
more stuff, faster, with higher energy and extraction, can coincide with falling labour-time per unit. That
is one reason ecological crisis and profitability pressures can move together rather than separately.

When natural conditions become *monopolised* (land, location, minerals), payments for access appear as
*rent*. Rent is not value created by nature; it is a claim on surplus value created elsewhere, enforced
by property rights over natural conditions.[Marx1894]

## A modern example: the smartphone

Consider a mid-range smartphone assembled in southern China for a large
brand.[DedrickKraemerLinden2010,Smith2016]

- The phone retails in London for, say, \pounds800.
- The total wage bill for assembly workers per phone might be on the order of \pounds10–\pounds15.
- The rest of the price covers constant capital (components, machinery depreciation, logistics), marketing, design, and various profits and rents.

The exchange-value of the phone vastly exceeds the direct wages paid in the
factory. Part of the explanation is that value from many segments of the
global supply chain is realised in the final sale; part is that monopolistic
firms capture *surplus value* generated across the chain. To understand
how, we need to go deeper into labour, surplus, and capital.
