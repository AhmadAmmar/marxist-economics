# Method: dialectical and historical materialism

Marx did not start from ethics (*capitalism is bad because it is
unfair*) but from a method of analysing how societies reproduce themselves
over time. In his words, capitalism is a “definite mode of production”
with its own laws of motion.[Marx1867,MarxGrundrisse]

## Materialism

Materialism starts from the simple fact that humans must labour on nature to
survive: grow food, build shelter, care for children, maintain bodies, repair
machines. The way this labour is organised—who controls the means of
production, who performs which tasks, who receives what share of the output—
gives rise to classes and class struggle.

The categories of Marxian economics are therefore not timeless. They are
historical forms of social relations. Wage-labour, profit, interest, rent,
and the world market are specific to capitalism, just as tribute, serf
labour, and feudal dues were specific to feudalism.

## Dialectics

Dialectics means thinking in terms of **contradictions** and
**totalities**, not isolated variables.

- A commodity is simultaneously useful (*use-value*) and an item for sale (*exchange-value*).
- Labour is simultaneously concrete activity (teaching, sewing, coding) and an abstract expenditure of human energy that creates value.
- Capitalist development raises productivity but also tends to reduce the share of living labour in production, undermining the very source of surplus value.

The dialectical move is to see how these opposites presuppose and transform
each other, rather than choosing one side. For instance, capitalism cannot
live without wage-labour; yet it constantly tries to replace workers with
machines and algorithms. It cannot live without states and borders; yet it
also needs global supply chains and mobile capital.

## Historicity

Historical materialism insists that our categories are historically specific.
The laws of motion of capitalism emerge from the separation of producers from
the means of production, the generalisation of commodity exchange, and the
subordination of production to profit.

The task is therefore to reconstruct, conceptually and empirically, how this
mode of production works: from the commodity up to crises, imperialism, and
the possibility of transition.[EngelsAntiDuhring,Shaikh2016]

### A note on levels of abstraction.

The ordering of this pamphlet follows a Marxist movement from the abstract to the
concrete, and from the simplest form of appearance to the more complex totality it
presupposes. We begin with the commodity and the value-form, because capitalism first
confronts us as a world of commodities, prices, and exchange relations. We then move
to labour-power as a peculiar commodity, because only there do we find the hinge that
makes profit compatible with apparently equal exchange. From that pivot we develop the
production of surplus value (necessary and surplus labour time) and the rate of
exploitation, before turning to how competition redistributes surplus value and, through
the formation of prices of production, generates systematic divergences between values
and market prices (see Section~sec:prices-production). On that basis we can treat credit and fictitious capital as claims
on future surplus value that can expand well beyond the limits set by production and
realisation, and therefore become a central transmission belt of crisis. We then extend
the analysis to world-scale determinations—imperialism and unequal exchange—and to
the reproduction of labour-power (social reproduction) as a material condition of
accumulation, not a separate moral or cultural “add-on.” Finally, we return to
contemporary restructurings of the labour process and capitalist control (including
platform power and AI): changes in technology and organisation that can transform how
exploitation is administered and intensified, without abolishing the underlying
relations that make value and accumulation possible.
