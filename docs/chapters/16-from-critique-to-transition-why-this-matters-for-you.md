# From critique to transition: why this matters for you

We can now step back and summarise what this conceptual and mathematical
journey offers.

## Diagnosing everyday exploitation

The categories of value, surplus value, constant and variable capital,
the \profitratefull, the \organiccompfull, and the \TRPFfull\ are not abstract curiosities. They allow you to:

- read your own wage, hours, and working conditions as part of a global struggle over necessary and surplus labour time;
- see how corporate profits, real-estate bubbles, and public austerity are linked through the circuits of capital;
- understand why reformist policies repeatedly run into structural constraints: profitability, capital flight, debt, and imperial pressure.

To know that your 8-hour shift contains 3 hours of necessary labour and 5
hours of unpaid surplus labour is not just a moral claim; it is a
quantitative, structural insight.

## Beyond capitalism: a world beyond exchange-value

Marx did not think capitalism would collapse automatically. Crises create
openings, but the direction of change depends on struggle: between classes,
between oppressed and oppressor nations, between patriarchal and emancipatory
forces.

A world beyond capitalism would mean:

- production organised directly for human needs and ecological sustainability rather than profit;
- democratic control over workplaces, infrastructures, and planning;
- the abolition of the wage relation and of private property in the main means of production;
- the withering away of the state as a specialised apparatus separate from society; and
- the freeing up of time and resources for care, creativity, and self-development.

In such a world, use-values rather than exchange-values would dominate. To be precise: a moneyless society is not achieved by merely banning banknotes. It requires dismantling
the social relations that make money necessary—generalised commodity production, wage-labour, and private
control over the main means of life. When core necessities are produced and distributed as rights, and when
access is organised directly through democratic planning and provisioning, money loses its function as the
universal key. The communist horizon is therefore the abolition of the value-form: not that “nothing has
value,” but that society no longer has to measure access and activity primarily through exchange-value and price. Money, classes, and borders would lose their reason for existence.

## Your place in the struggle

No single pamphlet can tell you what to do. But it can suggest some
directions:

- Organise in your workplace, campus, neighbourhood, and online networks; connect struggles over wages, housing, gender, race, and climate.
- Study collectively: read Marx, Engels, and contemporary Marxists; discuss; argue; relate theory to your experience.
- Build and support organisations—unions, feminist and queer collectives, socialist groups, tenant unions—that link immediate demands to the horizon of a classless, moneyless, stateless society.

Marx wrote that the point is not only to interpret the world, but to change
it.[EngelsFuneral] Understanding the logic of capital is one step
towards participating consciously in that change.
