# Why social democracy was a conjuncture, not an alternative system

Liberals often say: “Communism is too extreme. Let's aim for social democracy.” In everyday discussion,
“social democracy” is treated as if it were a different economic system: capitalism with a human face.
From a Marxist standpoint, that is a category mistake. Social democracy, where it existed in a strong form,
was not a separate mode of production. It was a historically specific *regime of managing capitalism*
under unusually favourable conditions for capital accumulation, and under unusually strong pressure from below.

This matters for strategy. If social democracy were simply a matter of political will and better policy,
then the task would be to elect kinder managers. But if it was a conjuncture inside capitalism—enabled by
post-war reconstruction, imperial advantage, high growth, and a particular balance of class forces—then the
question becomes: what happens when those conditions vanish? Marx's answer is not moral; it is structural:
capitalism can tolerate reforms only so long as they do not block the extraction and realisation of surplus value.

To make this concrete, we need a short historical map: how capitalism expanded globally, why wars and depressions
recur, why the post-war boom was exceptional, why neoliberalism followed, and why “returning” to that earlier
compromise is structurally blocked today.

## Colonialism, the world market, and why capital must expand

Capitalism does not grow peacefully inside national borders. It generalises commodity production and then
compels expansion: more markets, more inputs, cheaper labour, and new outlets for accumulated capital.
The world market is not a later “globalisation” add-on. It is built into capitalist development from early on.

Colonialism was a decisive mechanism in this expansion. It forcibly reorganised land, labour, and trade to
secure raw materials, open captive markets, and impose money taxes that pushed people into wage labour and
commodity dependence. In Marxist terms, this was not simply robbery for its own sake; it was the violent
construction of capitalist social relations on a world scale: dispossession, coerced labour, export monocultures,
and the subordination of entire regions to metropolitan accumulation.

As capitalist competition intensifies, the stakes rise. Capitals do not compete only as firms; they lean on
states for protection, subsidies, access, and coercion. Conflicts over markets, routes, strategic resources, and
investment territories therefore become conflicts between states. That is the material basis of modern imperialism:
the fusion of concentrated capital with state power in the struggle over world-scale conditions of accumulation.

This does not mean that every war has one simple cause. It means that, under capitalism, rivalry over world-market
advantage and control over conditions of accumulation is not accidental. It is structural.

## War, depression, and the reorganisation of capitalism (1914–1945)

The first half of the twentieth century shows the brutal logic of capitalist rivalry and crisis.

### World War I (1914–1918).

The First World War was an inter-imperialist conflict among major powers competing over colonies, markets,
routes, and geopolitical advantage. It was not a temporary lapse into irrationality; it was a catastrophic
expression of rivalry in a world where capitalist development had become uneven, combined, and militarised.

### The interwar instability and the Great Depression.

The 1920s and 1930s were shaped by unstable recoveries, debt burdens, and then collapse. The Great Depression
(ignited by the 1929 financial crash and deepened through the early 1930s) produced mass unemployment,
bank failures, and political crisis. States responded with protectionism, competitive devaluations,
and intensified nationalism. In Marxist terms, depression is not merely a shortage of demand; it is a crisis
of profitability, overaccumulation, and realisation in which too much capital has been accumulated relative to
profitably employable labour and markets at the prevailing conditions.

### World War II (1939–1945).

The Second World War was also rooted in imperial rivalry and the drive to reorganise world power. It destroyed
enormous masses of capital and human life. That destruction was barbaric—but it also reset conditions of
accumulation. One cannot understand the post-war boom without understanding that war and depression forcibly
restructured the system: debts were rewritten, industries were reorganised, and global leadership changed.

## The post-war boom and the social-democratic compromise (roughly 1945–early 1970s)

After 1945, much of Western Europe and Japan underwent reconstruction. The period from the late 1940s through
the early 1970s is often described as a “Golden Age” of capitalism: rapid growth, rising productivity, and,
in many countries, expanding welfare states and labour protections. It is this period that many people have in
mind when they say “social democracy.”

From a Marxist standpoint, three points are decisive.

### First: Keynesianism managed capitalism; it did not replace it.

Keynesian policy—state spending, public investment, welfare provision, and demand management—did not abolish
wage labour, private ownership, or profit as the regulator of investment. It aimed to stabilise accumulation,
smooth the cycle, and contain social conflict. In other words, it was a mode of governance inside capitalism,
not an alternative mode of production.

### Second: the compromise was forced from below.

Welfare gains were not gifts. They were concessions wrested from capital under conditions of militant unions,
strong socialist and communist parties, mass strike waves, and, internationally, the existence of a rival bloc
that frightened Western ruling classes. The post-war order was built in part to prevent revolution and contain
communism. The welfare state was therefore both a product of class struggle and a strategy of class rule.

### Third: the boom rested on exceptional material conditions.

Reconstruction created vast demand for steel, housing, transport, and industry. Productivity gains were high in
many sectors. US hegemony and new monetary arrangements stabilised key trade and financial relations. Cheap energy
inputs supported growth. These conditions made it easier for capital to tolerate redistribution for a time,
because the mass of profits could still expand.

But the compromise was conditional. It worked only so long as the underlying engine—profitability in the productive
economy—could sustain it.

## Why the boom broke: profitability, stagflation, and the crisis of the 1970s

The post-war boom did not end because society became less reasonable. It ended because capitalism's contradictions
reasserted themselves.

As accumulation proceeded, competitive pressures intensified, and overcapacity developed in key industries.
Profitability came under pressure. States could stimulate demand, but demand management cannot guarantee that
private capital will invest profitably. When profitability is weak, capital seeks other outlets: speculation,
real estate, financial claims, or relocation to cheaper labour regimes.

The 1970s were also marked by major oil shocks (notably 1973–74 and 1979), which raised costs across production
and transport. The resulting combination—sluggish growth with rising prices—became known as stagflation, a problem
that standard Keynesian tools were ill-suited to manage within capitalist constraints. From a Marxist perspective,
oil shocks were not the sole cause; they were a trigger and amplifier within a deeper profitability and accumulation
problem.

The political conclusion drawn by ruling classes was clear: the post-war compromise had to be dismantled to restore
profitability and discipline labour.

## Monetarism and neoliberalism: restoring class power

What followed is now called neoliberalism: privatisation, deregulation, attacks on unions, cuts to social spending,
and the reorientation of states toward “market confidence.” This was not merely an ideological fad. It was a class
strategy to restore profitability by reshaping the balance of power between labour and capital.[HarveyNeoliberalism]

Monetarism—the shift toward using interest rates and tight money as the primary policy tool—played a key role.
High interest-rate regimes disciplined wages, raised unemployment, and strengthened creditors. In Marxist terms,
this was a reassertion of capital's power through the labour market and through finance: a deliberate raising of the
social cost of resistance.

Neoliberalism also internationalised discipline. Trade liberalisation and global supply chains increased the credible
threat of relocation. Financial liberalisation increased the power of capital flight. States were increasingly told to
treat social spending as a cost, not a right.

This is why, even where social-democratic parties remained in office, they increasingly administered neoliberal policy.
The system's constraints tightened, and reformist parties became managers of austerity.

## The global South as laboratory: debt, coups, and structural adjustment

Neoliberalism was not rolled out only through elections. It was imposed through coups, repression, and debt regimes,
especially in the global South.

Latin America provides clear examples of “shock” restructuring: labour rights crushed, public assets privatised,
and economies opened to foreign capital. Debt crises—especially from the late 1970s into the 1980s—became a lever.
States dependent on external finance were pushed into IMF-style programmes: austerity, currency devaluation,
cuts to subsidies, and privatisation.[PeetUnholyTrinity] These policies were sold as “stabilisation,” but their class content was
consistent: shift crisis costs onto workers and the poor, open new fields for accumulation, and guarantee repayment
to creditors.

This history matters for countries like Pakistan because it clarifies that fiscal policy is not only a domestic choice.
External debt, import dependence, and creditor conditionality shape what states are “allowed” to do under capitalism.

## Belated capitalism, combined and uneven development, and the bourgeois-democratic impasse

A further clarification is needed for much of the global South: capitalism does not arrive everywhere as a
“clean” national development sequence in which an independent bourgeoisie steadily builds an industrial
base, completes land reform, secularises the state, and then deepens democratic participation. It arrives
*through a world market already dominated by monopolies, imperial states, and finance*, and it therefore
produces a pattern of **combined and uneven development**: advanced technologies and enclaves of modern
production sit alongside older property relations, coercive labour regimes, and vast zones of abandonment.[TrotskyPermanentRevolution,RosenbergUCD]
The result is not “underdevelopment” as a cultural failure, but a structured outcome of integration into a
hierarchical world economy.[LeninImperialism,PatnaikImperialism]

This matters because the classic tasks often associated with bourgeois-democratic revolutions—land reform,
a thorough secularisation of law and schooling, universal civil equality, democratic control over the state,
and the construction of an inclusive nation-state on a modern material basis—collide with the actual
interests and dependencies of local ruling classes in belated capitalist formations. A dependent bourgeoisie
typically sits at the intersection of landlordism, foreign capital, state contracts, and creditor discipline.
It therefore fears mass mobilisation from below more than it fears the survival of “pre-modern” coercions
and compromises. Even when liberal elections occur, decisive questions about investment, energy, trade,
security, and debt servicing remain constrained by property, the world market, and external conditionality.[PeetUnholyTrinity,HarveyNeoliberalism]

This is why the democratic question cannot be reduced to whether elections are formally competitive. In many
settings, the deeper absence is *popular decision-making power over the material organisation of life*:
what is built, where, for whom, with what labour conditions, and under what ecological constraints. When those
decisions remain governed by profitability, creditor confidence, and unelected coercive apparatuses, liberal
democracy becomes a narrow procedure for rotating managers of an order whose core decisions are insulated from
the majority.

### A note on “outliers”.

There are partial exceptions where state-led industrialisation achieved significant upgrading (often under
specific geopolitical conditions, with strong state direction of credit, export strategy, and sometimes land
reform). But even these cases do not refute the general point: capitalist development remains structured by the
world market, and democratic control over investment is not guaranteed by growth. The question is not simply
“development” but *who controls it* and *whose interests it serves*.

The strategic conclusion is not that elections never matter. It is that, under dependent and crisis-ridden
capitalism, the completion of democratic and social tasks cannot be entrusted to bourgeois parties whose
material reproduction depends on the very property relations and external constraints that block those tasks.
In that sense, what liberals treat as the horizon of “secular, democratic progress” becomes inseparable from
working-class struggle for power: decommodification of essentials, democratic control of investment, and
breaking the mechanisms of imperial and creditor discipline.[PeetUnholyTrinity,HarveyNeoliberalism]

## Financialisation and bubble-led management: dot-com to housing

As productive investment became more difficult or less profitable, capitalism leaned harder on finance, asset prices,
and credit expansion. This is the context for repeated bubble cycles.

A stylised pattern is:
- weak or uneven productive profitability;
- expanding credit and rising asset prices to sustain demand and paper wealth;
- speculative booms (equities, then real estate, then complex securities);
- crashes that socialise losses through bailouts, austerity, and restructuring.

The dot-com boom of the late 1990s and its bust around 2000–2002 showed how speculative expectations could inflate
claims far beyond realised profitability. The much larger global crisis of 2007–08 then demonstrated the same logic
at a systemic scale: mortgage-credit expansion, securitisation, and bank leverage created vast fictitious claims that
collapsed when repayment and realisation failed.

From a Marxist standpoint, these crises are not simply regulatory accidents. They are expressions of a system trying
to offset profitability and realisation problems by expanding financial claims.

## After 2008: austerity, revolt, and the rise of the far right

After 2007–08, states intervened massively to stabilise banks and financial markets, while much of the cost was pushed
onto working classes through austerity, wage restraint, privatisation, and degraded public services. This was not
“balanced” crisis management; it was class management.

The political consequences were explosive. Across different regions, we saw waves of revolt and experimentation:
Occupy-style movements, mass square occupations, anti-austerity uprisings, and attempts at electoral ruptures. The Arab
Spring expressed deep social contradictions under authoritarian and neoliberal regimes. In Europe, anti-austerity
projects rose and collided with the hard constraints of capital mobility, creditor power, and supranational governance.

Where the left failed to build durable organisation and a credible alternative, the right often filled the vacuum.
Far-right politics thrives by redirecting anger away from capital and toward scapegoats: migrants, minorities, women,
queer and trans people, religious targets, “corrupt elites” in the abstract. It offers belonging, revenge, and
authoritarian order while leaving property relations intact. Liberalism, which manages decline while preaching civility,
often cannot defeat this; it frequently feeds it by policing dissent and protecting wealth.

This is one reason the question of social democracy returns today as nostalgia: people feel the loss of security,
services, and meaning. But nostalgia is not a strategy.

## Why you cannot simply “return” to social democracy today

Even if one admires the best welfare achievements of the post-war period, restoring that regime today is structurally
blocked under contemporary capitalism.

1. **Capital mobility is greater.** Supply chains, finance, and ownership structures allow capital to move, threaten, and evade more easily. This strengthens the capitalist veto: disinvestment and capital flight become routine weapons against reforms.
2. **The global balance of class forces has shifted.** Union density and workplace power are weaker in many places after decades of defeat, repression, and fragmentation. Without strong organisation from below, welfare gains are easier to roll back.
3. **Debt and external constraints are tighter.** Many states operate under heavy debt burdens and creditor conditionality. In the global South, import dependence and foreign-exchange vulnerability amplify these constraints. This is why IMF-style programmes so often demand cuts to public spending and “market reforms.”
4. **The ecological constraint is now unavoidable.** The post-war boom assumed cheap energy and expanding throughput. Today, climate breakdown and ecological limits mean that a growth-at-all-costs welfare compromise is not a viable horizon.[IPCCAR6WGIII] Transition requires planning, not just redistribution.
5. **Financialisation changes the terrain.** Asset-price inflation, rent extraction, and private control of housing, energy, and infrastructure mean that cash-based reforms are often recaptured through prices unless essentials are decommodified.

This is why policy packages that promise a painless return—“just tax the rich,” “just print money,” “just do a Green
New Deal inside the market”—run into the structural limits already developed in this pamphlet. (See also the discussion
of the capitalist veto and crisis management in Section~sec:policy-fixes-veto.) Reforms matter, but
reformism fails: the system can shed a reform regime when profitability, competition, and class power demand it.

## What this means for strategy: reforms as struggle, socialism as a necessity

The Marxist conclusion is not that reforms are pointless. It is that reforms must be understood as *sites of struggle*
that can build power, expose limits, and create openings—rather than as a parliamentary substitute for transforming property
relations.

This has several practical implications.

- Fight for reforms that **decommodify essentials**: universal healthcare, housing, education, transport, energy, and care. These reduce capital's ability to recapture gains through rents and administered prices.
- Build **workplace power** and democratic organisation, without which legal rights become paper promises.
- Demand measures that **confront the capitalist veto**: controls on capital flight, democratic control of credit and investment, and socialisation of key sectors (especially finance, energy, and strategic infrastructures).
- Treat internationalism as material, not moral: without confronting imperialist and debt relations, national reform projects are strangled by external constraint.

In this sense, socialism is not a slogan chosen because it is morally superior. It becomes a practical necessity because
the problems people face today—crisis management by austerity, debt discipline, ecological breakdown, and the far-right
turn—are produced by a system in which production and investment are governed by profit and protected by private property.
A democratic, planned, internationally coordinated reorganisation of the economy is not the “extreme” option; it is the
option adequate to the scale of the contradictions.
