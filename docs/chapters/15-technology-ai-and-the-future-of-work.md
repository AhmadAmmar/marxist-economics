# Technology, AI, and the future of work

From automatic looms to industrial robots to AI systems, capital constantly
seeks to reduce its dependence on living labour. This is both a driver of
productivity and a source of contradiction.

## Automation and the law of value

Automation tends to increase $\constcap$ relative to $\varcap$, raising \OCC{}
and putting downward pressure on \profitrate{} (section sec:rate-profit). At
the same time, it cheapens many goods, raises the technical capacity of
society, and potentially frees time for education, art, care, and play.

Under capitalism, however, the gains of automation are unevenly distributed:

- some workers are displaced, others' labour is intensified;
- skills are polarised, with a few high-paid specialists and large layers of precarious, low-paid service workers;
- managerial and surveillance technologies extend the working day into the home via emails, apps, and metrics.

Despite the hype, AI does not abolish the law of value. Behind every
algorithm are infrastructures of material labour: data labellers, content
moderators, hardware assemblers, miners of rare-earth metals, and workers
maintaining data centres. Value is still created by human labour-power.

A particularly clear example is generative AI in offices, media, design, and “knowledge work.”
Much commentary treats it either as imminent mass automation or as a neutral productivity aid.
The more immediate dynamic is often neither: it is the *moving benchmark* of socially necessary labour time.

When a tool allows a task to be completed faster under normal conditions, the socially enforced norm
for that task shifts. What used to be an acceptable daily output becomes “slow”; what used to require
two workers is redefined as one worker’s baseline. The gain is not automatically returned to workers
as shorter hours or lower intensity. If wages and hours do not change, the same paid time is made to yield more surplus labour in practice, raising the realised rate of exploitation \(e=s/v\) even when the contract form remains unchanged. Under capitalist control, it is typically converted into new
targets, tighter deadlines, and higher throughput per unit time.

In Marxian terms, the point is simple. The working day is still split between necessary and surplus labour.
If the wage does not rise with the new benchmark, and if working hours do not fall, then raising output
by tools and metrics is a practical route to raising the effective rate of exploitation: more surplus
is extracted from the same paid time. This is why many workers experience “productivity tools” as speed-up,
surveillance, and exhaustion rather than emancipation.

## AI as a class weapon

In many workplaces, AI and digital systems are currently used as tools of
management and control:

- automated scheduling, productivity tracking, and ratings in logistics and platform work;[WoodEtAl2019]
- algorithmic management in call centres and warehouses;
- predictive policing and risk scoring in welfare systems.

From a Marxist perspective, the question is not “Will AI take our jobs?” in
the abstract, but who controls the technology, for what purpose, and how its
gains are distributed. Under capitalism, the default is to use AI to
intensify exploitation and surveillance, not to liberate time.

## Data centres, ecological cost, and democratic control of computation

The same clarity applies to the material infrastructure behind “AI”: data centres, fibre networks,
server farms, and the mining and assembly labour embedded in hardware. These are not abstract clouds;
they are energy- and water-intensive industrial systems.[IEADataCentres2019] The ecological question is therefore not
whether computation exists, but *what it is used for*, *who controls it*, and *how its costs
and benefits are allocated*.

A key point is that modern cloud infrastructure is software-defined and multi-tenant: the same physical
systems can run radically different workloads side by side. One class of workloads can be socially
necessary and life-saving—storm tracking, flood mapping, early warning systems, public health modelling,
grid optimisation, drought monitoring. Another class can be socially low-value but profit-rich—advertising
optimisation, mass surveillance, speculative content factories, endless synthetic media churn.
It is not the existence of servers as such that decides the outcome, but the social relations that schedule
and govern them.

A socialist response, therefore, is not technological abolition but social reorganisation: treat major
computational infrastructures as part of the means of production and bring them under democratic control.
That implies at minimum: transparent accounting of energy and water use; public rules that prioritise
life-preserving and scientific workloads; strict limits on wasteful, speculative, and coercive uses;
and open access to essential datasets and models as public goods rather than private moats.
In transition, this is one concrete meaning of freeing technology from the profit motive: directing
digital capacity toward collective planning and safety rather than accumulation and control.
