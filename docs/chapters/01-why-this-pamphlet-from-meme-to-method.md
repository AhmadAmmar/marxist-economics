# Why this pamphlet? From meme to method

On social media, you might see a graph about “the tendency of the rate of
profit to fall” or a meme about capitalism “needing infinite growth on a
finite planet”. The references are often to Karl~Marx, but the underlying
method and mathematics are rarely explained carefully.

This pamphlet is a long-form attempt to do that work.

A major reason careful method matters today is the culture of techno-utopianism.
We are repeatedly told that some new technology—a platform, a blockchain, a “smart” city,
a generative model—will fix politics, fix inequality, or fix ecology. Under capitalism,
these claims typically slide past the central question: *what changes in property relations,
and therefore in the organisation of production and reproduction*? A tool can be technically impressive
and still function primarily as a way to create new markets, intensify labour, privatise public goods,
or inflate speculative valuations.

In Marxian terms, this hype often functions as the cultural face of fictitious capital: it helps capitalise expectations of future monopoly positions and rent streams into present valuations, long before any socially useful diffusion has occurred. This pamphlet therefore treats technology neither as a saviour nor as a demon. The Marxian approach is
more concrete: ask who owns the means of production (including digital infrastructure), what labour processes
the tool reorganises, how it shifts socially necessary labour time and the pace of work, and how it creates
new opportunities for surplus extraction, monopoly rent, and control. That is the only way to separate
technical possibility from capitalist deployment.

With that in mind, it is aimed at two overlapping readers:

- the **university student**—often taught neoclassical economics and game theory while hearing that Marx is “relevant but outdated”, and
- the **modern urban worker**—in a call centre, logistics warehouse, software firm, school, hospital, or gig platform—who feels that their life is organised around work, debt, and stress, yet is told that “the economy” is an abstract thing they have no say in.

Marxian political economy offers:

1. a **method**—dialectical and historical materialism—for understanding how societies organise production and reproduction;
2. a **set of concepts and equations**—value, surplus value, constant and variable capital, the rate of profit, the organic composition of capital—that link everyday exploitation to macro dynamics; and
3. a **perspective on social change**: why capitalism generates recurrent crises and how collective action can point beyond it.

The aim is not to turn you into a specialist, but to give you enough
conceptual and mathematical grip that you can read Marx, contemporary Marxist
work, and even mainstream economic reports without feeling like the equations
and jargon are a priestly language.

Throughout, we will move back and forth between:

- *basic definitions* (commodities, value, labour-power),
- *formal relations* (simple equations and tables), and
- *concrete examples* (smartphone supply chains, garment workers in Bangladesh, real-estate speculation in Pakistan, logistics warehouses, platform work, AI automation).

Whenever we write $c$, $v$, $s$, $r$, or $e$, we are using
a standard Marxian shorthand. A summary of these symbols is given in Appendix~sec:notation, and they are developed
in more detail in Sections~sec:labour-surplus–sec:rate-profit.
